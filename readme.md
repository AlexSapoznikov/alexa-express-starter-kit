# Simple Amazon Alexa Starter Kit

This starter kit allows you to add new skills for Amazon Alexa easily. <br>
Configuration for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon</a>
is generated automatically and saved to **amazonConfig.txt** file,
so all you have to do is to copy it to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a><br>
**This kit uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app">alexa-app</a> module, visit the page
for more information about functionality and customizing server if needed.**

## Initialization
- ```git clone git@github.com:AlexSapoznikov/alexa-express-starter-kit.git```
- ```cd alexa-express-starter-kit/```
- ```npm install```

## Commands
- ```npm start``` - builds and starts server
- ```npm run start-dev``` - starts and restarts server on code change
- ```npm run build``` - builds without starting server
- ```npm run create-skill [-- --name=anyname]``` - creates new sample skill file in *skills* folder
- ```npm run expose``` - exposes your localhost to the internet
- ```npm run eslint``` - lints the code for errors
- ```npm run test``` - runs tests

## The Structure

- Development is being done in *./src* folder.
- The builded code is generated to *./public* folder.
- Configuration files are located in *./config*.
- Skills are located in *./src/skills/* folder.
- Skills are included in *./src/skills.js* file.
- Server creates intents (endpoints) automatically using merged skills in *./src/skills.js* file.
- Scripts for generating amazon configuration and new skill files are located in *./src/scripts* folder.
- Error messages are located in *./src/errorMessages.js* file

## How to add new skills

- Add new skill file via terminal
```
npm run create-skill -- --name=myNewSkill
```
- Edit the <a href="#skillfile">skill file</a> (*./src/skills/myNewSkill.js*).
- Start the server
```
    npm run start
    // or
    npm run start-dev
```

- For development, expose your localhost to the internet.
    - Start ngrok
    ```
        npm run expose
    ```
    - Look for the output to find alexa endpoint, it looks something like this: https://1234ccb1.ngrok.io/alexa

- Do a setup in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a>
    - Sign in to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a>
    - Add new skill
    - Copy-paste generated configuration from **./amazonConfig.txt** to required fields.
    - Use https url generated by ngrok in previous step
    
Alexa is now ready for testing.

- To invoke custom skill, say: *Alexa, ask [invocationName] [question using utterances]*
- For more information about invoking custom skills, visit <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/supported-phrases-to-begin-a-conversation">Amazon Developer commands page</a>

## <a name="skillfile">Skill file</a>

Skill file looks like this:

```
export default {
  skillName: 'dog',
  invocationName: 'dog',
  intents: [
    {
      intentName: 'dogNumber',
      slots: {
        number: 'AMAZON.NUMBER'
      },
      utterances: [
        'say the number {-|number}',
        'find {-|number}'
      ],
      response: (request, response) => {
        const number = request.slot('number');
        response.say(`The number you asked to say is ${number}`);
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

- skillName - name of skill that is displayed to customers in the Alexa app. Must be between 2-50 characters.
- invocationName - name that customers use to activate a skill.
- intents - array on intents
- intentName - name of intent
- slots - variables
- utterances - these are what people say to interact with skill
- response - handler function from alexa

### Handler

Request and response objects that can be used.<br>
Documentation about handler objects is copied from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app">alexa-app</a> npm module,
because current starter kit uses it's functionality.

#### Request

```
// return the type of request received (LaunchRequest, IntentRequest, SessionEndedRequest)
String request.type()

// return the value passed in for a given slot name
String request.slot("slotName")

// check if you can use session (read or write)
Boolean request.hasSession()

// return the session object
Session request.getSession()

// return the request context
request.context

// the raw request JSON object
request.data
```

#### Response

```
// tell Alexa to say something; multiple calls to say() will be appended to each other
// all text output is treated as SSML
response.say(String phrase)

// empty the response text
response.clear()

// tell Alexa to re-prompt the user for a response, if it didn't hear anything valid
response.reprompt(String phrase)

// return a card to the user's Alexa app
// for Object definition @see https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#card-object
// skill supports card(String title, String content) for backwards compat of type "Simple"
response.card(Object card)

// return a card instructing the user how to link their account to the skill
// this internally sets the card response
response.linkAccount()

// play audio stream (send AudioPlayer.Play directive) @see https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/custom-audioplayer-interface-reference#play-directive
// skill supports stream(String url, String token, String expectedPreviousToken, Integer offsetInMilliseconds)
response.audioPlayerPlayStream(String playBehavior, Object stream)

// stop playing audio stream (send AudioPlayer.Stop directive)
response.audioPlayerStop()

// clear audio player queue (send AudioPlayer.ClearQueue directive)
// clearBehavior is "CLEAR_ALL" by default
response.audioPlayerClearQueue([ String clearBehavior ])

// tell Alexa whether the user's session is over; sessions end by default
// you can optionally pass a reprompt message
response.shouldEndSession(boolean end [, String reprompt] )

// send the response to the Alexa device (success)
// this is not required for synchronous handlers
// you must call this from asynchronous handlers
response.send()

// trigger a response failure
// the internal promise containing the response will be rejected, and should be handled by the calling environment
// instead of the Alexa response being returned, the failure message will be passed
response.fail(String message)

// calls to response can be chained together
response.say("OK").send()
```


#### Session

```
// check if you can use session (read or write)
Boolean request.hasSession()

// get the session object
var session = request.getSession()

// set a session variable
// by defailt, Alexa only persists session variables to the next request
// the alexa-app module makes session variables persist across multiple requests
// Note that you *must* use `.set` or `.clear` to update
// session properties. Updating properties of `attributeValue`
// that are objects will not persist until `.set` is called
session.set(String attributeName, String attributeValue)

// return the value of a session variable
String session.get(String attributeName)

// session details, as passed by Amazon in the request
session.details = { ... }
```

## Server

Look ./src/server.js file in the code. <br>
Following handlers are added for editing:
- app.launch
- app.pre
- app.post
- app.sessionEnded
- app.error

For more functionality and options visit <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app">alexa-app</a> npm module.
