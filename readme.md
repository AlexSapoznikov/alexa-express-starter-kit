# Simple Amazon Alexa Starter Kit

This starter kit allows you to add new skills for Amazon Alexa easily. <br>
Configuration for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon</a>
is generated automatically and saved to **amazonConfig.txt** file,
so all you have to do is to copy it to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a>

## Initialization
- ```git clone git@github.com:AlexSapoznikov/alexa-express-starter-kit.git```
- ```cd alexa-express-starter-kit/```
- ```npm install```

## Commands
- ```npm start``` - builds and starts server
- ```npm run start-dev``` - starts and restarts server on code change
- ```npm run build``` - builds without starting server
- ```npm run create-skill [-- --name=anyname]``` - creates new sample skill file in *skills* folder
- ```npm run expose``` - exposes your localhost to the internet
- ```npm run eslint``` - lints the code for errors

## The Structure

- Development is being done in *./src* folder.
- The builded code is generated to *./public* folder.
- Configuration files are located in *./config*.
- Skills are located in *./src/skills/* folder.
- Skills are included in *./src/skills.js* file.
- Server creates intents (endpoints) automatically using merged skills in *./src/skills.js* file.
- Scripts for generating amazon configuration and new skill files are located in *./src/scripts* folder.

## How to add new skills

- Add new skill file via terminal
```
npm run create-skill -- --name=myNewSkill
```
- Edit the skill file (*./src/skills/myNewSkill.js*).
- Start the server
```
    npm run start
    // or
    npm run start-dev
```

- For development, expose your localhost to the internet.
    - Start ngrok
    ```
        npm run expose
    ```
    - Look for the output to find alexa endpoint, it looks something like this: https://1234ccb1.ngrok.io/alexa

- Do a setup in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a>
    - Sign in to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon Alexa website</a>
    - Add new skill
    - Copy-paste generated configuration from **./amazonConfig.txt** to required fields.
    - Use https url generated by ngrok in previous step
    
Alexa is now ready for testing.
- Use the command: *Alexa, ask [invocationName] [question using utterances]*
